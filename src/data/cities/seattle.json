    "description": "Seattle experiences a temperate oceanic climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The city's location in the Pacific Northwest means it receives abundant rainfall during the winter months, while summers are typically dry and sunny. Seattle's climate supports its vibrant outdoor lifestyle, from hiking in the nearby mountains to kayaking on Lake Union. The city's numerous parks and gardens thrive in the mild climate, while the dry summers are perfect for outdoor festivals and events. The famous Pike Place Market and waterfront activities are year-round attractions, though the summer months offer the most comfortable conditions.",
