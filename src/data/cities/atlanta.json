The city's elevation of about 1,050 feet (320 m) above sea level helps moderate temperatures slightly. Spring and fall are particularly pleasant, with mild temperatures and colorful foliage. Atlanta's climate supports a vibrant urban lifestyle with a mix of indoor and outdoor activities year-round, from cultural events to outdoor festivals.",
