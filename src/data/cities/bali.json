With average daily highs around 30°C and over 2,800 hours of sunshine annually, Bali attracts digital nomads, retirees, and travelers seeking a laid-back island lifestyle. The island experiences a distinct wet and dry season, with the dry season (May to September) offering clear skies and ideal conditions for beach activities, hiking, and cultural exploration. From sacred temples and rice terraces to surf beaches and yoga retreats, Bali's blend of natural beauty and spiritual richness makes it one of the most beloved destinations in Southeast Asia.",
