The area's rich cultural heritage, ancient temples, and vibrant arts scene make it a popular destination. The climate supports an outdoor lifestyle, from temple visits to mountain hikes, while the cooler winter months provide perfect conditions for exploring the city's historic old town and surrounding nature.",
