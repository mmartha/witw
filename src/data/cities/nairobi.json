    "description": "Nairobi enjoys a subtropical highland climate due to its elevation of 1,795 meters (5,889 feet) above sea level. As Kenya's capital and largest city, Nairobi offers a unique blend of urban sophistication and natural beauty. The city's climate is characterized by mild temperatures year-round, with distinct wet and dry seasons. Despite being located near the equator, Nairobi's high altitude creates a pleasant climate that supports its reputation as the 'Green City in the Sun'. The city serves as a major gateway for safari adventures and is home to Nairobi National Park, the only national park within a capital city.",
